        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicke breast halves -
                cut into finger-sized pieces
            </li>
            <li>1/4 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of bread crumbs</li>
            <li>2 egg whites, beaten</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of water</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Coat a baking sheet with 
                a nonstick spray.
            </li>
            <li>In a bag, mix together flour, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder,
                1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. On a plate, 
                mix the bread crumbs with the rest of the garlic powder, cayenne 
                pepper, and salt.
            </li>
            <li>Shake the chicken pieces with the seasoned flour. Beat egg whites 
                with 1 tablespoon water, and place egg mixture in a shallow dish or 
                bowl. Dip seasoned chicken in egg mixture, then roll in the seasoned 
                bread crumb mixture. Place on prepared baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>Bake for about 8 minutes in the preheated oven. Use tongs to turn 
                pieces over. Bake 8 minutes longer, or until chicken juices run clear.
            </li>
        </ol>
