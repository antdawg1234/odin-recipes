    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These cinnamon roll cookies are a new twist to the cinnamony snickerdoodle 
            cookie.
        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 & 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling out dough</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of fine salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of butter, softened</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of shortening</li>
            <li>1 & 1/2 cups of white sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of ground cinnamon, or as desired</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift together all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Beat together butter and shortening using an electric mixer in 
                another bowl until combined; add sugar and continue beating until 
                light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Pour in eggs, one at a time, 
                beating well after each addition. Pour in flour mixture and blend 
                until batter is smooth.
            </li>
            <li>Dust a work surface with flour and roll out cookie dough with a 
                floured rolling pin into a 1/4-inch thick rectangle. Sprinkle 
                cinnamon generously over the dough. Roll up the dough gently into 
                a log starting on one of the long sides. Wrap tightly in plastic 
                wrap and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>Unwrap the dough log and carefully slice into 1/4-inch pieces 
                without smashing down the cookie. Place on an ungreased baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden around the edges, about 
                12 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
